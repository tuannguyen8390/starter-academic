Howdy ! I'm Tuan (call me Twain if you found Vietnamese are too tricky to pronounce) - proudly Vietnamese/Australian currently living in Melbourne, Australia. At the moment I'm employed as a research scientist in computational biology at **Agriculture Victoria** working in dairy cows genetics & genomics. In addition, I still have some side quests with the aquaculture world relating to some old projects during PhD. 

I classified myself as a computational biologist with a very big interest in applied genomics technologies in agriculture. In particular (i) application of ultra-long read sequencing like Nanopore or Pacbio or (ii) single cell/spatial transcriptomics.

If you want to have a quick chat about anything (*trust me I won't bite :P*), please ping an email to my tuan[dot]nguyen[at]agriculture[dot]vic[dot]gov[dot]au !
