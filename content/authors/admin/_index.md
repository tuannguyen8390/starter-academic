Howdy ! I'm Tuan (call me Twain if you found Vietnamese are too tricky to pronounce) - proudly Vietnamese/Australian currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm a research scientist in computational biology at [**Agriculture Victoria**](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/), working under the supervision of Dr Iona MacLeod in the field of genetics & genomics for dairy cattle. In particular, the field of genotype imputation. In addition, I still have some side quests with the aquaculture world relating to a few old projects during my PhD at the [**University of the Sunshine Coast**](https://usc.edu.au).

I classified myself as a computational biologist with huge interests in applied genomics technologies in agriculture. In particular (i) application of *ultra-long read sequencing* like **Nanopore** or **Pacbio** or (ii) single cell/spatial transcriptomics by **10X Genomics**. Throughout my career, I've been in contact with so many great mentors that show me the wonders of computational biology and I've decided that this is the career I want to pursue in the long run. I can code in **BASH**, pretty advanced in graphing with **R**, knows enough **Python** to code some quickie tools for data analysis and willing to pick up skills in **ML/AI**. I also picked up a new interest recently in reproducible science with version control with **Git** and workflows like **NextFlow**.

Please do visit my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrKangabu), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tuan_Nguyen33), or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-nguyen-38a94179/) to know more about my previous & current research.
