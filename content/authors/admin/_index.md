Howdy ! I'm Tuan (call me Twain if you found Vietnamese are too tricky to pronounce) - proudly Vietnamese/Australian currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm a research scientist in computational biology at [**Agriculture Victoria**](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/), working under the supervision of Dr Iona MacLeod in the field of genetics/genomics for dairy cattle. I'm specialized in population analysis using SNP array, short-read and long-read sequencing, dealing with a whole range of thing including variant (SNP or structural variant) analysis, phasing, imputation, GWAS.. In the past, I've done a fair bit of bulk RNA-sequencing in the aquaculture world during my PhD at the [**University of the Sunshine Coast**](https://usc.edu.au), [**Queensland University of Technology**](https://qut.edu.au), and [**International University**](https://hcmiu.edu.vn/en/). 

I classified myself as a computational biologist with huge interests in applied genomics technologies in agriculture. In particular (i) application of *long read sequencing* like **Nanopore** or **Pacbio** and (ii) Deployment of scalable, portable, reproducible workflows (like **Nextflow**/**Snakemake**) in bioscience and (iii) Implication of cloud computing (**AWS**) in agriculture. Throughout my career, I've been in contact with so many great mentors that show me the wonders of computational biology and I've decided that this is the career I want to pursue in the long run. I can code in **BASH**, pretty advanced in graphing with **R**, knows enough **Python** to cook some quickie tools for data analysis, have recently learned **Rust** and pick up some knowledge in **ML/AI/XAI**. I'm also very familiar with version control tools like **Git**, **Markdown**.

In addition to dry-lab skills, I have some knowledge in the wet-lab space. Familiar with things like DNA/RNA extraction, sequencing library prep, gene-silencing (dsRNA), receptor assay, PCR & qRT-PCR... 

I'm very active on social media. Please do visit my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrKangabu), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tuan_Nguyen33), or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-nguyen-38a94179/) to know more about my previous & current research.
